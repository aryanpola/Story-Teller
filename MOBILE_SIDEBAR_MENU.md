# Mobile Navigation Improvements

## Sidebar Menu Implementation

The mobile UI has been enhanced with a slide-out sidebar navigation menu to improve the user experience on the OnePlus 9 device. This change addresses the issue of buttons colliding in the header area.

### Key Changes

1. **Hamburger Menu Button**
   - Added a hamburger menu button to the top-left corner of the header
   - This button toggles a sliding sidebar menu

2. **Sidebar Navigation**
   - Created a slide-out sidebar from the left side of the screen
   - Added animated transitions for smooth opening/closing
   - Included semi-transparent backdrop that closes the sidebar when tapped

3. **Menu Organization**
   - Moved navigation links to the sidebar for better organization
   - Added user profile information at the top of the sidebar when logged in
   - Included all important navigation links with appropriate icons

4. **Language Selector**
   - Enhanced language selector in the sidebar with flags and language names
   - Maintained a minimal language selector in the header

5. **Visual Design**
   - Used gradient background matching the app's color scheme
   - Added subtle hover effects for better touch feedback
   - Ensured text is readable with appropriate contrast

### Mobile Viewport Optimizations

- Added support for very small screens with a custom 'xs' breakpoint
- Made header elements responsive to different screen sizes
- Reduced padding and text sizes on smaller screens
- Added proper mobile layout containment

### How to Use

1. **Open the Sidebar**: Tap the hamburger menu icon (â‰¡) in the top-left corner of the screen
2. **Navigate**: Tap on any menu item to navigate to that page
3. **Close the Sidebar**: Either tap the X button in the top-right of the sidebar or tap anywhere on the semi-transparent backdrop

### Technical Implementation

- Used Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Used AnimatePresence for proper enter/exit animations
- Added proper state management for sidebar open/close status
- Implemented accessibility considerations
- Used responsive design principles for different device sizes

These improvements provide a cleaner and more organized UI on mobile devices, particularly on the OnePlus 9 where screen real estate is limited.
