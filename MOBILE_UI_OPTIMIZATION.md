## Testing on OnePlus 9

The app has been optimized specifically for the OnePlus 9 with the following considerations:
- Screen dimensions: 1080 x 2400 pixels (20:9 aspect ratio)
- Fixed horizontal scrolling issues
- Ensured proper container sizing relative to the device width
- Optimized tap targets for the device's touch sensitivity

## Further Improvements

If any issues persist after these changes:

1. Run the app on the device and check for specific UI elements that still cause horizontal scrolling
2. Use browser developer tools in remote debugging mode to identify overflow elements
3. Consider implementing device-specific styles if needed

To run the optimized app on your OnePlus 9 device:

```
npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap run android
```
