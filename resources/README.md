# Resources for Capacitor

This directory contains resources for the Capacitor mobile app version:

- `splash.png`: The splash screen image (recommended size: 2732x2732 pixels)
- `icon.png`: The app icon (recommended size: 1024x1024 pixels)

## Generating Icons and Splash Screens

To generate all necessary icon and splash screen assets for both iOS and Android, run the following command after placing your source images in this folder:

```
npx @capacitor/assets generate
```

This will create optimized icons and splash screens for both platforms.
